# Python Port Scanner using Standard Libraries

This Python script scans all TCP ports on a target host and prints a message indicating which ports are open. It uses only standard libraries and can be run on any system with Python installed.

## Usage

To use the port scanner, simply run the port_scanner.py script with the IP address of the target host as a command-line argument:

```shell
python3 port_scanner.py <target_host>
```

For example, to scan the ports on a host with IP address `192.168.1.1`, run:

```shell
python3 port_scanner.py 192.168.1.1
```
